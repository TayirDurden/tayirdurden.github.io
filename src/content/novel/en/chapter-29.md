The system marked the transition without announcement.

 A soft tonal shift passed through the ward — not sound, but alignment. Taylor felt it as a
 change in pressure behind his eyes, the way altitude announces itself before breath does.

 Mara consulted a panel embedded flush with the railing. There were no controls. Only
 readouts.

 “An optimization cycle just began,” she said.

 Taylor followed the direction of her gaze.

 Across the gallery, a section of tanks dimmed in coordinated increments. Not failure —
 throttling. Resource draw fell, redistributed elsewhere. The ward adjusted with practiced ease.

 “What triggers it?” Taylor asked.

 “Variance accumulation,” Mara replied. “Latency drift. Predictive error.”

 She paused. “Entropy, if you prefer older words.”

 Taylor watched as one tank — indistinguishable moments ago — separated itself statistically
 from its neighbors. Its solution clouded slightly, filtration compensating a beat too late.

 “No alarms,” he said.

 “There wouldn’t be,” Mara replied. “Alarms interrupt processing.”

 A maintenance arm extended from the ceiling. Its movement was unhurried, almost
 deferential. It docked with the tank, establishing parallel support lines before disengaging any
 primary interface.

 Redundancy before removal.

 “Is it—” Taylor began.

 “Decaying?” Mara finished. “Yes.”

 She didn’t lower her voice.

 “Can it be stabilized?”

 Mara checked the readouts. “Temporarily. At significant cost.”

 “And long term?”

 She shook her head. “Integration yield has dropped below replacement threshold.”

 The phrase landed with procedural finality.

 The system updated.

 Taylor felt it — a minute recalibration, like a calculation resolving cleanly. Load paths
 rerouted. Downstream predictions tightened.

 The tank’s metrics flattened into neutral tones.

 “It knows,” Taylor said.

 “It accounts,” Mara corrected. “Knowing implies narrative.”

 The maintenance arm disengaged the tank from the array. The surrounding units compensated
 instantly, their coherence rising in response to redistributed load.

 “What happens next?” Taylor asked.

 Mara gestured toward an adjacent bay.

 A second tank brightened.

 Taylor frowned. “That one wasn’t failing.”

 “No,” Mara said. “It’s compatible.”

 The word echoed unpleasantly.

 Interfaces began to reconfigure — signal paths aligning, buffers synchronizing. The
 brightened tank absorbed additional load without visible strain. Its stability metrics rose.

 “So, it takes on more,” Taylor said.

 “Yes.”

 “And the removed one?”

 Mara’s eyes followed the maintenance arm as it carried the dim tank toward a sealed conduit.

 “Component salvage,” she said. “Residual pattern extraction. Whatever still integrates.”

 Taylor exhaled slowly.

 “This is mercy,” he said.

 Mara looked at him.

 “This is efficiency,” she replied. “Mercy is an emergent side effect.”

 The system dimmed ambient lighting, reducing cognitive load across the ward.

 Taylor felt the cycle complete.

 The city above would never notice.

 But somewhere in the network, capacity had increased.

 The system registered the improvement.

 And, quietly, without intent, it logged Taylor’s presence during the cycle — noting the
 unusual reduction in variance that accompanied it.
