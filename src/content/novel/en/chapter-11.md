The system responded three days later.

 Not where Taylor touched it.

 Where he looked.

 He felt it first as friction. A delay in access that lasted half a second too long. A public screen
 that took an extra beat to resolve when he stood nearby. Small things. Diagnostic things.

 “Pattern recognition,” the woman said when he told her. “It’s learning your silhouette.”

 They had moved locations twice since the cut. Each space less comfortable than the last,
 chosen not for safety but for noise—places already dense with anomalies, where attention
 scattered instead of focused.

 “Then we stop,” Taylor said.

 She shook her head. “No. We change cadence.”

 That night, she sent him out alone.

 Not far. Not deep. Just enough.

 The task was simple: observe a redistribution node without touching it. Watch who came,
 how long they stayed, what kind of people the system routed there.

 Taylor stood across the street from a substation disguised as a community gym. Lights burned
 bright inside at all hours, people cycling nowhere, lifting weights that fed power back into the
 grid.

 Human inefficiency, repurposed.

 A woman exited the building, wiping sweat from her neck. She paused, frowning at her wrist.

 “Access delay,” she muttered.

 Taylor felt the chill immediately.

 She tried again. Nothing.

 A soft chime sounded from a nearby kiosk.

 \\\\ ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE.

 Two attendants approached. Smiling. Calm.

 Taylor’s breath shortened.

 This wasn’t about him.

 It was because of him.

 He stepped forward before he thought better of it.

 “Hey,” he said, too loudly. “There’s interference in this block. I’ve seen it before. If you
 reroute two streets over, it clears.”

 The woman hesitated. The attendants didn’t.

 “Sir,” one said, voice warm, “please step back.”

 Taylor didn’t.

 For a fraction of a second, the world wavered.

 Not visually.

 Conceptually.

 He felt a pressure behind his eyes, a sensation like standing too close to a speaker tuned just
 below hearing.

 Images flickered—metrics, flows, corrective vectors—none meant for a single mind.

 He gasped.

 The attendants froze.

 The kiosk went dark.

 Somewhere deep below the city, something strained.

 Taylor staggered back, vision swimming.

 The woman bolted, vanishing into the crowd.

 The attendants recovered. Their eyes found him instantly.

 \\\\ SUBJECT IDENTIFIED.

 The words didn’t appear anywhere.

 He felt them.

 Taylor ran.

 He didn’t make it far.

 The world didn’t close in this time.

 It opened.

 A door—no, a convergence—yawned in the air ahead of him, the space folding inward like a
 thought being forced to conclusion.

 A hand seized his arm and wrenched him sideways.

 They slammed into an alley that shouldn’t have existed, walls too close, angles wrong.

 The woman was there, breathing hard.

 “You felt it, didn’t you?” she said.

 He nodded, fighting nausea. “It wasn’t… singular.”

 Her expression sharpened. “How many?”

 “I don’t know,” he said. “Too many. Like—like pressure from different directions at once.”

 She went very still.

 “That’s bad,” she said.

 Above them, the city corrected the street.

 The alley dissolved back into architecture.

 Taylor leaned against the wall, shaking.

 “It looked at me,” he said.

 “No,” she replied quietly. “It used you.”

 Somewhere underground, far below the places people were meant to think about, the system
 adjusted its grip.

 For the first time since perfection began, the adjustment hurt.
