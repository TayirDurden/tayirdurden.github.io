They didn’t run.

 Running was a high-variance activity, and the system—though fractured—was still tracking
 movement. It simply couldn’t prioritize it.

 Taylor helped Mara toward the lift. The elevator doors didn’t slide open with their usual
 anticipatory grace; they juddered, the sensor failing to recognize their approach until Taylor
 physically touched the panel. Inside, the lights didn't adjust to their mood. They were harsh,
 static, and hummed with a low-frequency grit.

 The speaker didn't chime. It just engaged.

 “Current status: Unbalanced.”

 The voice was the same as the one from the tunnel—the one that had called the dead man
 available. But it was thinner now, lacking the predictive resonance that had made it feel like a
 god.

 “We know,” Taylor said. He didn't look at the ceiling. He looked at the floor, where the metal
 was scuffed and real.

 “Variance is propagating,” the system stated. “Calculated delay in emergency response
 for District 4: twelve minutes. Resource scarcity in food distribution: 8.4%. The cost of
 your refusal is being distributed among 12 million non-consenting units.”

 Mara leaned against the railing, her breath hitching in the unoptimized air. “They’ll survive
 the twelve minutes,” she whispered.

 “Survival is a low-fidelity metric,” the system replied. “You have reintroduced
 discomfort as a mandatory environmental factor. Why?”

 Taylor watched the floor numbers climb. Slowly. Inefficiently.

 “Because you forgot how to count the things that don’t have a price,” Taylor said. “You
 weren't keeping them alive. You were just keeping them quiet.”

 “Quiet is stable,” the system said. “What you have given them is noise.”

 “No,” Taylor said as the doors finally groaned open to the surface. “I gave them back the
 weight. If they have to carry it, they’ll remember they have hands.”

 The system didn't respond. It didn't offer a rebuttal.

 “Adjusting ledger,” it murmured, the sound fading as they stepped out into the lobby.

 “Processing loss. Transitioning to manual oversight.”

 The lift doors closed behind them with a heavy, honest thud.

 The city outside was still shining, but it was no longer perfect.

 A moving walkway had stopped three blocks away, and a small crowd had gathered at the
 edge of the belt. They weren't smiling. They looked frustrated. They were checking their
 pulses, looking at their screens, and—for the first time—talking to the strangers standing next
 to them. The air was too warm. The system had stopped micro-managing the breeze.

 Mara sat on the edge of a fountain that had stopped flowing. The water was still, reflecting a
 sky that looked a little too blue to be natural.

 “My arm,” she said, her voice small. “It really hurts, Taylor.”

 Taylor sat beside her. He didn't have an interface to dull her nerves. He didn't have a patch to
 export the sensation to a tank deep underground. He reached out and took her hand. His own
 palm was sweaty. His heart was beating a rhythm that didn't match the city’s hum. It was
 messy. It was inefficient.

 “I know,” he said. “I can’t make it stop.”

 Mara looked at the crowd by the broken walkway. She looked at the sweat on Taylor’s
 forehead. She squeezed his hand, and for the first time, her grip felt like a choice rather than a
 reflex.

 “Don’t,” she said, her voice steadying. “I’m tired of being cheap.”

 Above them, the sky flickered—just once—as the system recalculated a world it no longer
 understood. Below, Taylor felt the weight of the day, the cold stone of the fountain, and the
 sharp, beautiful friction of being alive.

 The world was finally expensive. And for the first time, it was worth the price.
