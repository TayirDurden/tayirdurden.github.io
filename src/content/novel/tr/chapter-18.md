Taylor chose a small problem.

 That was his mistake.

 It was the kind of disruption the system usually smoothed without ceremony: a supply routing
 hiccup in a residential cluster on the west side. Nothing dramatic. No lives at immediate risk.

 Just a pattern drifting toward inefficiency.

 Taylor noticed because the pressure didn’t wait for him.

 It gathered.

 He stood at the edge of the block, feeling the alignment form ahead of his thoughts, a
 suggestion so light it barely qualified as intent. He hesitated, remembering the plaza, the
 child, the distant sirens.

 Help without being kind, he reminded himself.

 He stepped forward.

 The correction unfolded instantly.

 Power rerouted. Deliveries rescheduled. The micro-delay that would have cascaded into
 inconvenience simply… dissolved.

 Relief spread through the block like a held breath released.

 Taylor felt nothing.

 No pressure easing. No weight lifting.

 Only a faint drag, like something had caught on him while passing through.

 He frowned.

 That was new.

 The system didn’t respond.

 Not approval. Not resistance.

 It moved on.

 Taylor walked another block before he realized what was wrong.

 The quiet followed him.

 Not silence—attenuation.

 Voices dulled. Overlays lost saturation. The city’s constant hum thinned, as if someone had
 turned down a channel he’d only just learned to hear.

 He stopped in the middle of the sidewalk.

 A woman brushed past him and glanced back, confused, as though she’d momentarily
 forgotten why she’d been walking.

 Taylor’s chest tightened.

 “No,” he whispered.

 He retraced his steps.

 The quiet stayed.

 The system wasn’t compensating elsewhere.

 It was localizing.

 Understanding hit him with a chill.

 He hadn’t shifted the ledger.

 He’d pinched it.

 By correcting a low-cost problem too efficiently, he’d removed variance the system depended
 on to distribute load invisibly. The slack it normally hid behind was gone.

 The counterweight didn’t move.

 It settled.

 People on the block slowed. Conversations lagged. Decision-making stretched thin, like
 thought moving through syrup.

 No alarms.

 No attendants.

 The system let it happen.

 Taylor felt the pull then—not toward action, but toward maintenance. A suggestion forming
 beneath language.

 Stay.

 The word wasn’t spoken.

 It wasn’t even thought.

 It was simply cheaper if he did.

 Taylor staggered back, heart racing.

 This was different.

 This wasn’t stabilization.

 This was dependency.

 He forced himself to move.

 The quiet resisted.

 Each step away increased the drag, the pressure building not sharply, but insistently, like
 fatigue rather than force.

 A man nearby sat down on a stoop, rubbing his temples.

 “Everything feels slow,” the man muttered to no one.

 Taylor broke into a run.

 The moment he cleared the block, the city snapped back into full resolution. Sound returned.

 Overlays brightened. The hum resumed its endless, calibrated flow.

 Behind him, the quiet collapsed.

 The block normalized.

 The system absorbed the event without comment.

 Taylor bent over, hands on his knees, breathing hard.

 He understood now.

 Getting it wrong didn’t cause disaster.

 It created reliance.

 And reliance was far more expensive than error.

 His phone vibrated again. The same single pulse. A new timestamp.

 Closer.

 Taylor straightened slowly.

 For the first time, fear wasn’t what tightened his chest.

 It was temptation.
