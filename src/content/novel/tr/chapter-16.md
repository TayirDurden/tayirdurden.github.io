They shouldn’t have gone there..

 Taylor knew it the moment the pressure softened.
 The district sat just outside the city’s newer arteries, an area the system treated with a careful,
 economical neglect. Overlays were present but muted. Guidance lagged half a second behind
 intent. People moved slower—not from comfort, but from habit.
 “This place feels… gentle,” Taylor said.
 She stopped walking.
 “No,” she said immediately. “We leave.”
 He turned to face her. “Why?”
 “Because this is exactly where the rule applies.”
 The pressure here wasn’t directional. It didn’t push or pull. It rested.
 Taylor could feel it settling around him like a coat someone else had already worn.
 “Nothing’s happening,” he said.
 “That’s the problem,” she replied. “The system isn’t correcting. It’s letting variance
 accumulate.”
 They were halfway across a small plaza when the first anomaly appeared.
 A child stood near a fountain, staring at nothing.
 Taylor felt it before he saw it—the slight misalignment, the way the hum skipped a beat
 around her. No alerts. No assistance prompts. Just a pocket of quiet inside the larger quiet.
 “She’s not connected properly,” he said.
 The woman’s jaw tightened. “We don’t intervene here.”
 Taylor looked at her. “You just told me the system is letting this happen.”
 “Yes,” she said. “Because intervening here costs more than correcting elsewhere.”
 The child swayed.
 Taylor stepped forward.
 “Stop,” she said.
 He hesitated—then froze.
 The pressure surged, not harshly, not urgently. Kindly.
 Like a hand at his back.
 Taylor felt alignment bloom effortlessly. The child’s pocket of silence collapsed into
 coherence. Her posture straightened. The hum smoothed.
 She blinked.
 Then smiled at him.
 “Thank you,” she said, though he hadn’t spoken.
 The moment passed.
 And the cost arrived.
 The plaza quieted further. Too much.
 People slowed, then stopped, as if waiting for something they couldn’t name. Overlays
 dimmed, not failing, but receding.
 Taylor felt it—the redistribution. What he’d corrected locally had been compensated globally.
 “Taylor,” she said softly. “What did you do?”
 “I fixed one thing,” he replied.
 “You shifted the ledger,” she said. “Here.”
 A man across the plaza staggered, clutching his head. Another sat down abruptly, breath
 shallow. No alarms sounded. No attendants came.
 The system absorbed the deviation.
 Somewhere else.
 Not here.
 “This place was stable because it was cheap,” she said. “You made it expensive.”
 Taylor’s stomach dropped.
 “I didn’t mean—”
 “I know,” she said. “That’s why the rule matters.”
 Sirens finally approached—but not for this plaza. Their sound echoed from far away,
 redirected toward a different neighborhood.
 Taylor felt the weight of it then, crushing and intimate.
 “This is where kindness fails,” she said. “When it’s not coordinated.”
 He looked at the child again. She was already gone, running toward someone calling her
 name.
 Saved.
 Balanced.
 At a distance he couldn’t see.
 “We can’t stay together,” she said suddenly.
 He turned sharply. “What?”
 “You amplify effects just by being near me,” she said. “My margins are already fractured.
 Yours aren’t.”
 “That’s not—”
 “It is,” she cut in. “And if we keep moving like this, the system won’t need to notice us
 deliberately. We’ll be obvious.”
 The pressure stirred again, faint and approving.
 Taylor clenched his fists.
 “So what?” he asked. “I stop helping?”
 She shook her head, eyes shining with something like grief.
 “No,” she said. “You learn to help without being kind.”
 They stood in the plaza as motion slowly resumed, the system smoothing over the imbalance
 with practiced indifference.
 Above them, the city recalculated.
 Below them, something recorded a new constraint:
 Localized compassion increases systemic variance.
 No correction followed.
 The rule had failed.
 And now Taylor would have to live with what came after.
