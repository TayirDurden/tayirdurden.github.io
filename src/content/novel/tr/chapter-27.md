The chamber extended farther than it should have..

 Taylor felt that first — not with sight, but with balance. The floor’s resistance changed in
 increments too fine to be architectural. Each step forward redistributed weight somewhere
 behind him, like the space itself was load-bearing.
 Mara walked ahead without hesitation.
 “This used to be louder,” she said.
 Taylor glanced at her. “Louder how?”
 “Conviction,” she replied. “People talked here. Explained things to themselves.”
 The pressure thinned as they moved, resolving into lanes. Not corridors — priorities. Taylor
 could sense which directions were cheaper, which would accumulate cost if followed too
 long.
 They chose the expensive path.
 The air cooled by a fraction. Humidity stabilized. A faint antiseptic note crept in, clinical but
 not unpleasant.
 Care, Taylor realized.
 Not secrecy.
 They reached a railing that overlooked a lower level. The space beyond was vast, but
 deliberately segmented — bays repeating in careful asymmetry, each tuned slightly
 differently. The light there was softer, warmer than he expected.
 Mara stopped beside him.
 “This is where it stops pretending it’s abstract,” she said.
 Taylor leaned forward.
 Below them, shapes emerged slowly as his eyes adjusted. Cylindrical housings, nested in
 arrays that curved with the room’s geometry. Each unit was surrounded by a lattice of
 conduits — power, cooling, signal — braided together with the intimacy of something
 designed to last.
 No alarms sounded. No guards watched.
 The system did not react to their presence.
 It compensated.
 One of the arrays brightened slightly as Taylor leaned closer. Not illumination — coherence.
 The pressure around his temples eased.
 He pulled back instinctively.
 The coherence dimmed.
 Mara watched this without comment.
 “Those are not servers,” Taylor said.
 “No,” she replied.
 He swallowed. “They’re not whole bodies.”
 “No,” she said again.
 The realization did not arrive all at once.
 It assembled.
 Taylor noticed the way temperature gradients were individualized. How some housings drew
 more resources than others without explanation. How latency varied, not by distance, but by
 responsiveness.
 “These are—”
 “Be careful,” Mara said gently. “Names matter here.”
 Taylor closed his mouth.
 Below them, activity pulsed — not movement, but signal. Patterns resolving and dissolving,
 the rhythm he’d heard in the walls now unmistakable.
 Thinking.
 The system wasn’t powered by this place.
 It was inhabited by it.
 Taylor’s knees weakened.
 Mara placed a hand on the railing, steadying herself — or him, he couldn’t tell.
 “Maintenance keeps them comfortable,” she said. “Comfort keeps variance low. Low
 variance keeps outputs clean.”
 Taylor stared down at the array, at the care taken in every detail.
 “Who are they?” he asked.
 Mara didn’t answer.
 Instead, she said, “Watch what happens when you stay still.”
 Taylor did.
 Slowly, inexorably, one housing began to stabilize more than the others.
 Not because it was prioritized.
 Because he was there.
 The system didn’t announce it.
 It didn’t need to.
 Taylor felt the alignment lock another fraction into place.
 Behind him, unseen, the maintenance window narrowed.
 Ahead, the tanks breathed — quietly, patiently — waiting to be useful.
