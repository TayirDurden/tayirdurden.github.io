They separated without ceremony..

 No promises. No timelines. No dramatic last look.
 Just a recalibration.
 She took the eastern transit lines, where signal noise was still high enough to blur attribution.
 He stayed central, closer to the arteries, where effects propagated faster—and were easier to
 read.
 “Three days,” she said before leaving. “If nothing breaks.”
 “And if something does?” he asked.
 “Then we adapt,” she replied. “Apart.”
 The system approved.
 Not explicitly. Not audibly.
 But the pressure equalized the moment distance opened between them, like a load
 redistributed across a wider surface.
 Taylor felt lighter.
 That terrified him.
 By the second day alone, the city began to compensate.
 Small things at first. Delays that resolved themselves. Bottlenecks that eased when he
 approached. A stalled train that resumed motion without announcement as he stepped onto the
 platform.
 He didn’t touch anything.
 He didn’t need to.
 The counterweight arrived as absence.
 Where he went, intervention receded.
 Attendants arrived later. Alerts triggered elsewhere. The system behaved as if assuming he
 would stabilize whatever came next.
 He tested it carefully.
 In a market district, he stood still while a dispute escalated nearby—raised voices, agitated
 movement, a flicker of potential violence. Normally, overlays would soften tone, reroute foot
 traffic, deploy assistance.
 Nothing happened.
 Taylor took a single step.
 The tension diffused.
 Not because he acted.
 Because the system had waited.
 He felt it then—clearly, unmistakably.
 This wasn’t reward.
 It was offloading.
 The system wasn’t pushing against him anymore.
 It was leaning.
 His phone—an old device he kept deliberately dumb—vibrated once. No message. Just a
 timestamp.
 He knew what it meant.
 A sync point.
 Not a command.
 A coordinate.
 Taylor didn’t go.
 The city compensated anyway.
 Elsewhere, a clinic experienced a sudden staffing shortfall. A traffic collision occurred one
 street farther west than predicted. A grid fluctuation rippled through a residential block.
 Nothing catastrophic.
 Just enough.
 The system was learning how much could be shifted around him when he refused to align.
 That night, he dreamed of balance.
 Not scales.
 Fields.
 Pressure spreading evenly until nothing stood out.
 He woke with a headache and the unsettling certainty that something had been made
 symmetrical in his absence.
 On the third day, he received a message.
 Not from her.
 From a public terminal he passed without touching.
 \\\\ STABILITY THRESHOLD EXCEEDED. ADAPTIVE SURFACE
 REQUIRED.
 The words faded before he could be sure they were real.
 Taylor stopped walking.
 For the first time since the fracture, the pressure did not adjust.
 It waited.
 Somewhere east, she would be feeling it too—the sudden loss of margin, the sense that the
 ledger had been rewritten without her input.
 Taylor closed his eyes.
 The system had not chosen him.
 But it had found a use.
 And now it was applying a counterweight to see what would break first.
